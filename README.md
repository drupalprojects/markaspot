http://yourserver/admin/structure/types/manage/report/fields

3. Copy and paste the lat/lon values into the settings of the Mark-a-Spot configuration screen

## Updating from 2.5 or 2.6

Depending on your theme you have to update your templates for displaying status and category colors. Color field module and Icon API modules are required.
